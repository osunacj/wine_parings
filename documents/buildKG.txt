[Developing Knowledge Graphs]

To build a knowledge graph from text, we typically need to perform two steps:
    - NER - Extract entities, a.k.a. Named Entity Recognition (NER), which are going to be the nodes of the knowledge graph.
    - RC - Extract relations between the entities, a.k.a. Relation Classification (RC), which are going to be the edges of the knowledge graph.
However these methods do not always yield the best relationship and sometimes they are limited.

Relation extraction is an end to end process that tackles both prior steps simultaneously. REBEL is the name of a model that follows this approach.

The authors published their dataset in HuggingFace -> https://huggingface.co/datasets/Babelscape/rebel-dataset

Step to create a smart Knowledge Graph from text are:
    - Relation Extraction (RE)
    - Load text and model
    - Tokenize the text
    - The model is trained to generate relationships betweeen words.
    - The output of the model is parsed to relations
    - Entity linking (Napoleon and Napoleon Bonaparte are the same)

TACRED is a large scale exraction dataset with over 100,000 examples over newswire and web text. -> https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/tacred/

Wiki80 tranining dataset containing 80 different relationship packs.  The same semantic categories of relationships used on Wikipedia are also used in the treaining data.
