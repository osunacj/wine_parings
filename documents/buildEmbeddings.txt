Exploiting Food Embeddings for Ingredient Substitution

- Identifying ingredient substitutes for cooking recipes can be beneficial for various goals, such as nutrient optimization or avoiding allergens. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be valuable tools to make
use of the vast cooking-related knowledge available online, and aid in finding ingredient alternatives. Despite
previous approaches to identify ingredient substitutes, there is still a lack of research in this area regarding the
most recent developments in the field of NLP. On top of that, a lack of standardized evaluation metrics makes
comparing approaches difficult. In this paper, we present two models for ingredient embeddings, Food2Vec
and FoodBERT. In addition, we combine both approaches with images, resulting in two multimodal representation models. FoodBERT is furthermore used for relation extraction. We conduct a ground truth based
evaluation for all approaches, as well as a human evaluation. The comparison shows that FoodBERT, and
especially the multimodal version, is best suited for substitute recommendations in dietary use cases
